		<h2>College</h2>
			<p>I will be playing sports for high school so hopefully I will get a scholarship to a collage for playing sports. Some of the colleges I would like to get picked up by Oregon, Oregon State, UCLA, Washington, Washington State, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, LSU etc... After that I hope to go into the MLB.  </p>

		<h2>Career Interests</h2>
			<p>I would like to make it to the MLB. But, if not I would like to make baseball gloves for Wilson or Rawlings. If not that I would like to work at Mommoth mountain at the ski resort, or become a professional skater, snowboarder.  </p>
