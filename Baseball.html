		<h1>All About My Baseball Career</h1>

		<h2>How Old Was I When I Started?</h2>
		<p>The first time I played in an actual game was when I was 3. I've been playing baseball for 10 years now. I've been on 8 teams through out my baseball career 5 of them were reck ball and the other 3 were travel ball teams. I will hopefully make the highschool baseball team and maybe even play in college also and maybe the majors.</p>

		<h2>What Position Do I Play?</h2>
			<p>On the field I play the middle infield but mostly 2nd base. Sometimes when I play outfield I play center field. Most of the people on the team call me "Tuve" which is Jose Altuve's nick name that his teammates call him. My teammates call me "Tuve" because i'm short like him(Jose is only 5'4 compared to Aaron Judge which is 6'7) and I get on base alot but I wish that I had his speed.
